This past year by practicing meditation and dance I have found myself realizing the importance of safety. 
Physical safety in the freedom from sexual oppression and violence around my body and emotional safety in the freedom to 
express feelings without a set of guidelines that regulate the kind of person I must be. I believe these safetys are 
imperatives every body is entitled to. With that in mind, I also understand that these safetys I value may not be valued 
in the same way by others. In some cases, this value is not considered as such because it does not seem immediately 
fruitful to the basic needs of survival; food, water, shelter, and sleep which can be bought or exchanged for money.
